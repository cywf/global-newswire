This is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [GlobeNewswire APIs](http://api.prnewswire.com). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [GlobeNewswire APIs](http://api.prnewswire.com).

They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.

Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.
